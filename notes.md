1. Who is the user we are talking to?
2. Why are we tageting them?
3. How do they use our solution?

Summary: 
- I would like the user to input their zip code to find the happy hour locations near them. 
- I want to scrape the website so that we can find the 10 happy hour spots in their area
- I would like the user to access any of these happy hour locations and provide the user the times, address, and what kind of deals they will get

Classes:
- Happy hour locations (store)
- CLI (interaction with the user)
- Scrapper
